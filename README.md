# Tabs at bottom

Firefox tab bar at bottom of window.

![screenshot](Screenshot.png)

Firefox userChrome JS script.

Tested on firefox 91.

Difference from other CSS code:
- Use JS to move tab bar DOM to bottom, not CSS
- Handle fullscreen also

> Notice: do not load this code by tab bar itself, or firefox will infinite loop.

---------------------

This repo only contains the specific function, doesn't contain the code to enable userchrome scripts.

**For how to enable, see: (also more of my scripts)**
