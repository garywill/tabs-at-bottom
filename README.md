Firefox userChrome JS script

Tested on firefox 91.

> Notice: do not load this code by tab bar itself, or firefox will infinite loop.



---------------------

This repo only contains the specific function, doesn't contain the code to enable userchrome scripts.

**For how to enable, see: (also more of my scripts)**
